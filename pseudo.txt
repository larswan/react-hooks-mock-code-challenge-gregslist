When the app starts, I can see all listings.
// make a request for images and one time useEffect []


I can "favorite" and "unfavorite" a listing on the frontend by clicking the star icon. This feature doesn't need backend persistence.
// add listing to favorites
state called favorites/set favorites onCLick reverse favorites


I can remove a listing from the page by clicking the trash can icon. This change should be persisted in the backend.
// click event feth request to remove..

componentDidMount() {
    // Simple DELETE request with fetch
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', { method: 'DELETE' })
        .then(() => this.setState({ status: 'Delete successful' }));
}


I can search for listings by their name.
// form event .map filter e.target.value === listing.name
